## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### Branch Strategy
- **Feature branches** ‚Üí **develop** ‚Üí **main**
- **develop**: Automatic deployment to staging
- **main**: Manual approval for production deployment

### Environments
- **Staging**: https://sbhubwebapp2024-staging.azurewebsites.net
- **Production**: https://sbhubwebapp2024.azurewebsites.net

### Security Pipeline
1. Dependency vulnerability scanning
2. Container image security scanning
3. SAST scanning with CodeQL
4. Automated security result reporting

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Set up GitHub Secrets** for Azure deployment
2. **Create staging environment** in Azure
3. **Test complete pipeline** end-to-end
4. **Record video demonstration** following exact sequence
5. **Prepare for oral viva** with technical knowledge
6. **Submit repository and video** before deadline

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Repository must remain public throughout assessment period
- All environments must be accessible during assessment
- Video must show real-time pipeline execution
- Prepare for technical questions based on video demonstration
- Ensure all work is original and properly attributed
