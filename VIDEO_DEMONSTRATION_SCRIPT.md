**Script:**
"Hello, my name is Emmanuel Nyadongo, and welcome to my Phase 3 assessment video demonstration. Today I'll be showcasing the complete CI/CD pipeline for my Session Buddy Hub application.

Let me start by showing you the currently deployed production application. I'll navigate to the production URL..."

*[Open browser and navigate to production URL]*

"As you can see, the Session Buddy Hub application is live and fully functional. The application features a modern, responsive interface with authentication capabilities, study session management, and a clean user experience. The application is successfully deployed on Azure Web Apps and is accessible to users worldwide.

Let me also show you the GitHub repository where all our code is managed..."

*[Open GitHub repository]*

"This is our main repository where we maintain our codebase, track changes, and manage our deployment pipeline. You can see we have a well-structured project with proper branching strategy."

---

### **STAGE 2: Code Modification** (2:00 - 5:00)

**Files to Open:**
- VS Code/Cursor: `src/pages/Index.tsx`
- Terminal/Git Bash

**Script:**
"Now I'll demonstrate the development workflow by making a small, visible code change. I'll modify the welcome message on the homepage to show how our CI/CD pipeline handles code changes.

Let me open the main Index component..."

*[Open src/pages/Index.tsx in editor]*

"I'll make a simple but visible change to the welcome message. Let me update the hero section text to demonstrate our deployment process."

*[Make the following change in the hero section: Change "Welcome to StudyBuddy Hub" to "Welcome to StudyBuddy Hub - Phase 3 Demo"]*

"Perfect! I've made a visible change to the welcome message. Now I'll follow the Conventional Commits standard to commit this change. Let me create a new feature branch first..."

*[In terminal: `git checkout -b feature/demo-welcome-update`]*

"Now I'll add the changes and commit them using the Conventional Commits format..."

*[In terminal: `git add src/pages/Index.tsx`]*
*[In terminal: `git commit -m "feat: update welcome message for Phase 3 demonstration"`]*

"Notice I'm using the 'feat:' prefix as per Conventional Commits standard, followed by a clear description of the change. Now I'll push this to the new feature branch..."

*[In terminal: `git push origin feature/demo-welcome-update`]*

"Excellent! The change has been pushed to the feature branch. Let me show you the commit in our repository..."

*[Navigate to GitHub repository and show the new commit]*

"As you can see, our commit is now visible in the repository with the proper Conventional Commits format."

---

### **STAGE 3: Staging Deployment** (5:00 - 10:00)

**Files to Open:**
- GitHub: Create Pull Request
- GitHub Actions: `https://github.com/emmanuelnyadongo/session-buddy-hub/actions`
- Browser: `https://sbhubwebapp2024-staging.azurewebsites.net`

**Script:**
"Now I'll create a pull request to merge our changes into the develop branch, which will trigger our staging deployment pipeline."

*[Create Pull Request from feature/demo-welcome-update to develop]*

"I'm creating a pull request with a descriptive title and detailed description of the changes. This will automatically trigger our CI/CD pipeline."

*[Show the pull request being created]*

"Perfect! The pull request has been created and our pipeline is now executing. Let me navigate to the GitHub Actions tab to show you the build process..."

*[Navigate to GitHub Actions]*

"Here you can see our comprehensive CI/CD pipeline in action. Let me explain each stage:

**Build Process:** The pipeline starts by checking out the code and setting up the Node.js environment. It then installs dependencies for both frontend and backend, runs security audits, and performs static code analysis using CodeQL for security vulnerabilities.

**Testing Procedures:** Our pipeline includes comprehensive testing - we run Jest tests for the backend API, Vitest tests for the frontend components, and perform type checking with TypeScript. All tests must pass before deployment can proceed.

**Security Scanning:** We use multiple security measures including npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities, CodeQL for static application security testing, and Trivy for container vulnerability scanning. This ensures our application is secure before deployment.

**Container Build:** The pipeline builds a Docker container with our application and pushes it to Azure Container Registry, ensuring consistent deployment across environments."

*[Show pipeline progress and explain each step as it executes]*

"Now let's wait for the pipeline to complete and then demonstrate the change on our staging environment..."

*[Wait for pipeline completion]*

"Excellent! The pipeline has completed successfully. All tests passed, security scans are clean, and the container has been built and deployed. Now let me show you the staging environment..."

*[Navigate to staging URL]*

"As you can see, our change is now live on the staging environment. The welcome message has been updated to 'Welcome to StudyBuddy Hub - Phase 3 Demo'. This staging environment allows us to test changes in a production-like environment before deploying to production."

---

### **STAGE 4: Production Release** (10:00 - 12:00)

**Files to Open:**
- GitHub: Merge Pull Request
- GitHub Actions: Production deployment
- Azure Portal: Application monitoring

**Script:**
"Now I'll demonstrate the production release process. First, I'll merge our changes into the main branch, which will trigger the production deployment pipeline."

*[Merge the pull request to main branch]*

"The pull request has been merged to main, which automatically triggers our production deployment pipeline. Let me show you the production deployment process..."

*[Navigate to GitHub Actions to show production deployment]*

"Notice that our production deployment includes additional security measures and requires manual approval for critical deployments. This is a best practice for production environments.

Let me explain our monitoring and alerting configuration:

**Monitoring Dashboard:** We have comprehensive monitoring set up in Azure Application Insights that tracks application performance, user behavior, and system health. This includes response times, error rates, and resource utilization.

**Alarm Configuration:** We've configured alerts for critical metrics such as high error rates, slow response times, and resource exhaustion. These alerts are sent to our development team to ensure quick response to any issues.

**Health Checks:** Our application includes automated health checks that verify the application is running correctly and can handle requests."

*[Show Azure monitoring dashboard if available]*

---

### **STAGE 5: Verification** (12:00 - 14:00)

**Files to Open:**
- Browser: Refresh production URL
- GitHub: CHANGELOG.md

**Script:**
"Now let's verify that our changes have been successfully deployed to production. I'll refresh the production URL..."

*[Refresh production URL]*

"Perfect! As you can see, our welcome message change is now live on the production environment. The text now reads 'Welcome to StudyBuddy Hub - Phase 3 Demo', confirming that our automated deployment was successful.

Let me also show you the updated CHANGELOG.md file, which automatically tracks all our deployments..."

*[Open CHANGELOG.md in GitHub]*

"Here you can see the automated CHANGELOG entry that was created during the deployment process. It includes the deployment date, commit hash, and the person who triggered the deployment. This provides a complete audit trail of all changes.

**Summary of Successful Automated Deployment:**

Our CI/CD pipeline has successfully demonstrated:

1. **Automated Testing:** All tests passed automatically
2. **Security Scanning:** Multiple security checks completed successfully
3. **Staging Deployment:** Changes were deployed to staging for testing
4. **Production Deployment:** Changes were safely deployed to production
5. **Monitoring:** Comprehensive monitoring and alerting is in place
6. **Documentation:** Automated CHANGELOG updates provide deployment history

This demonstrates a complete, professional-grade CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality, security, and reliable deployments. The entire process from code change to production deployment was automated and completed successfully.

Thank you for watching my Phase 3 assessment demonstration!"
